# Paint-Clone

Canvas HTML Element has been used to create a basic version of MS Paint and font-awesome icons were used for assigning icons.
The UI/UX was developed using HTML5 and CSS3 whereas functionality was provided by JavaScript
Lets just see the functionality of this application in brief:-
a)At the top, we have a toolbar with a series of font-awesome icons if we hover over them. A title that comes up explains what they do.

b)There is a brush icon, a background color icon, and an eraser icon that clears the canvas. On hovering over, the red color indicates that it's a destructive action.

c)One can save to local storage, load from local storage, clear local storage, and also save an image file.

d)On the left side, there is something that just says brush which is intended to show which tool is active.

e)It also shows up the default message when an action is executed by clicking as an example it says Canvas Saved when one clicks the save to local storage icon.

f)A custom color input called J.S. Color was imported to make sure that it looks the same regardless of browser or operating system.

g)To the left of the background color, we have the brush and a slider here. The slider allows the user to change the size of the brush up to 50 pixels.

h)The user could choose to clear the canvas and then load back from local storage. Lastly, the user has the ability to save the drawing as a jpeg by pressing on the save icon.
